"genie walks you through a few questions and then suggests the operation mode that is best for you."
"You can always change the mode by running the Setup Wizard again."
"Router Mode"
"Access Point Mode"
"Click here to see an illustration."
"This mode allows you to take advantage of NETGEAR <a href="genie_router_functions.htm" target="_blank">router functions.</a> The NETGEAR router is set up as a normal WiFi router behind your existing router or gateway. This mode requires that all of your devices be connected to the new NETGEAR router and not to your existing gateway."
"This mode is apporpriate for easy setup if devices are already connected to your existing router or gateway, or if you just want to use this new NETGEAR router to extend your WiFi coverage. Some <a href="genie_router_functions.htm" target="_blank">router functions</a> are not available in access point mode."
"Learn More"
"Router vs. Access Point"
"genie detected that you are trying to install your new NETGEAR router behind another gateway, for example, the DSL or cable gateway from your Internet service provider. Usually a gateway also provides WiFi or Voice over Internet (VoIP) function. You can install your NETGEAR router in two different operation modes."
"Router"
"Access Point"
"This mode configures your new NETGEAR router as a normal WiFi router behind your gateway and creates a separate network behind your gateway. To take full advantage of these router's advanced funcstions, NETGEAR recommends that you use router mode. In router mode, the only device that can be connetcted to your existing gateway is your new NETGEAR router. You must connect all of your devices to the new NETGEAR router. If your existing gateway has a WiFi function, disable it."
"Some <a href="genie_router_functions.htm" target="_blank">advanced functions</a> like Remote Management still neeed configuration on the gateway. For more information, see your gateway's documentation."
"If you want ot use the new router to get better WiFi performance beyond what you have with your existing gateway, access point mode is the easiest way to do that. NETGEAR recommends that you disable the WiFi function on your existing gwateway, if it has WiFi functionality. With this mode, you can connet wired devices to the gateway and connect wired and WiFi devices to your new NETGEAR router."
"In this mode, by default, the new router's IP address is assigned by your gateway dynamically and is unlikely to be 192.168.1.1. However, you can still use the URL <a href="www.routerlogin.net" target="_blank">http://www.routerlogin.net</a> to access the router's management GUI from a device connected to the router. Some <a href="genie_router_functions.htm" target="_blank">router functions</a> are not available in this mode, and you must use router mode if you want to use those functions."
"Router Functions"

"Advanced Functions"
"Your Current Network"
"genie detected that you use a gateway for your Internet connection. If you want ot use all of your new router's functions, NETGEAR recommends router mode. genie needs to ask you a few questions to verify that router mode is appropriate for you."
"Do you currently use <a href="geine_router_functions.htm" target="_blank">advanced functions</a> like <a href="geine_port_forward_help.htm" target="_blank">port forwarding</a> (sometimes called port mapping) on your existing gateway, or do you assign a static IP address to a device on your home network? These functions are usually used by advanced users. If you have never heard of these functions, select <b>No</b> because it's likely that you don't use them."
"Port forwarding(sometimes called port mapping) allows access to your home network through the Internet. If you have a device like a web server at home that others access remotely using a host name that you registered (usually through a dynamic DNS service) or using an IP address, you probably have the port forwarding function enabled. If you have never heard of this function, even if you have remote access to a device at home, It's likely you don't use this function."
"NETGEAR recommends that you set up this new router in access point mode because it does not require any configuration changes on your gateway."
"If you are advanced user and know how to configure your gateway to support some of these advanced functions, you can click the <b>Back</b> button and configure the NETGEAR router in router mode."
"For the router mode to operate correctly, you must connect all your WiFi and wired devices to the NETGEAR router, except equipment provided by your Internet service provider, such as a TV set-top-box or cordless phones connected to your gateway."
"Can you disconnect all your other devices (wired and wireless) from the existing gateway and then connect them to the NETGEAR router?"
"NETGEAR recommends that you set up this new router in router mode."
"Router mode allows you to use all the advanced features of your NETGEAR router. You can always run the Setup Wizard again to change the mode later."
"<p>NETGEAR recommends that you disable your existing gateway's WiFi to avoid these problems:</p><ul><li>Accidental connection to the existing gateway instead of the new NETGEAR router</li><li>Interference between the new NETGEAR router and the existing gateway's WiFi</li></ul>"
"To avoid Wifi interference that might compromise WiFi performance, NETGEAR recommends that you disable your existing gateway's WiFi"
"Can you disable your existing gateway's WiFi?"
"Copy your current WiFi settings from the existing gateway and enter them here. Then disable your existing gateway's WiFi."
"2.4GHz Wireless Network Name (SSID): "
"2.4GHz Wireless Network Password (Network Key): "
"5GHz Wireless Network Name (SSID): "
"5GHz Wireless Network Password (Network Key): "
"To prevent your WiFi devices from connection to the existing gateway, use the following name (SSID) and password  (network key) to connect all your WiFi devices to this router."
"This router's wireless settings have been changed. Use the following wireless network name (SSID) and network key (password) to reconnect your device to the router, then click the <b>Finish</b> button below to complete the installation."

"Frequently asked questions for your NETGEAR product are answered here."
"How can a new computer or wireless device connect to my wireless network"
"To join the network, you can select it and enter its password, or if your computer supports Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), you can use a WPS push-button or PIN to join the network.<br><br><B>Joining a network without using WPS: </B>How you do this depends on what kind of computer you have. For example, on a Windows PC, you can open Wireless Network Connection, select the network, and enter the network password. If you are using a NETGEAR wireless adapter, you can use its Smart Wizard to connect. <br><br><B>Using WPS to join a network:</B>  Press the WPS button on the router, then within 2 minutes click the WPS button on your computer or wireless device. The computer or wireless device joins the network. <br><br>If you changed the wireless network name and network password, and you don’t remember what they are, you can log in to the router from a computer already on the network to view these settings.  The user name for the router is <b>admin</b>. Its default password is <b>password</b>.  <br><br>If you have a preset router, it came with a unique wireless network name and network password. Both of these are on the router label. <br><br>To log in to the router, go to <a href = 'http://routerlogin.net'>http://routerlogin.net</a> log in select Wireless Settings, and get the wireless network name (SSID) and security information."
"What to do first when there is no connection to the router or the Internet"
"Try this power cycling sequence first to solve a network connection issue:<br><br>1.Turn off and unplug the power of the modem<br>2.Turn off the router<br>   3.Plug in the power of the modem and turn it on. Wait for 2 minutes<br>4.Turn on the router and wait for 1 minute"
"I can connect to the router, but not to the Internet"
"If you can connect to the router but not to the Internet, log in to the router and make sure the Internet Service Provider (ISP) settings are correct. These settings are located in the Basic Settings page on <a href = 'http://routerlogin.net'>http://routerlogin.net</a>. The correct settings depend on your broadband service. Typically for DSL, you enter the DSL username (like xxx@att.net) and the DSL password.<br><br>If you are unsure which settings to use, contact your ISP.<br><br>If you have Internet through cable service, make sure your cable modem is powered off and then on during router set-up. If the router still does not get an Internet connection from the modem, it could be because the modem remembers the previous device's MAC address (for instance, the MAC address from the computer that you used to access the Internet before you got a router). You can enter that device's MAC in the Basic Settings page on <a href = 'http://routerlogin.net'>http://routerlogin.net</a>."
"What is the password to log in to my router?"
"The router user name is <B>admin</B>.<br><br>The default password is <B>password</B>.<br><br>Try the default password before restoring factory settings.<br><br>If your NETGEAR router supports <b>Password Recovery</b>, enables it when you change router password. <br><br>If you restore factory settings all your router’s set up information is lost and you will need to set it up all over again! For example,  the router will not remember  your Internet connection settings or any other custom settings that you specified<br><br>So, have your ISP information ready before restoring factory settings."
"What kind of wireless security should I use for my network?"
"To secure your wireless network, NETGEAR recommends WPA2 or WPA wireless security (WEP is an old standard and is not recommended). Wireless security helps protect your network from hackers and unauthorized users.<br><br>If you have a preset router, it has a unique wireless network name and is also set up with WPA/WPA2 wireless security and a unique password.  Others who buy the same model of router will have different wireless network names and different passwords for their networks. <br><br>For NETGEAR routers, you can set up WPA2 or WPA with the NETGEAR genie or Smart Wizard, or you can log into your router at <a href = 'http://routerlogin.net'>http://routerlogin.net</a> and go to Wireless Settings page. After you set up wireless security on the router, anyone who tries to connect wirelessly must enter the network passphrase or key that you set up. Otherwise they will not be able to connect."
"Troubleshooting Wireless Networks"
"Each wireless device on the wireless network must have the same settings:<br><br><B>SSID</B>: The wireless network name is case-sensitive. (Netgear is different from NETGEAR). If you have a preset router, it has a unique wireless network name, which is on its label. The default SSID for other NETGEAR wireless routers is NETGEAR.<br><br><B>Channel</B>: The wireless channels are 1 to 11 in North America (1 to 13 in other countries).<br><br><B>Mode</B>: The wireless mode should be set to infrastructure mode for clients (computers) to connect to a wireless router.<br><br><B>Encryption</B>: You have these options for encryption:<br><B>.</B>No security<br><B>.</B>Use WEP<br><B>.</B>Use WPA-PSK<br><B>.</B>Use WPA2-PSK<br><br><B>Wireless radio</B>: This should be ON (the router's wireless LED should be lit.)<br><br><B>Access Control List (ACL)</B>: If you enable an ACL on your router, make sure the MAC address of each wireless adapter is included in that list."
"One PC is not connected to the Internet, but other PCs are"
"Make sure this PC is set to Obtain an IP address automatically and Obtain DNS server address automatically for its IP address. You can right-click the network connection and select <B>Properties</B> then <B>TCP/IP Properties</B> to check or change the settings.<br><br>You should be able to ping www.routerlogin.net after setting it to automatic IP address.<br><br>If you change these settings for a PC, you might have to reboot it to enable it to access the network."

"WEP is supported. However, WiFi Alliance mandates that a wireless router must not run WEP security mode when its wireless speed is set to 11n mode. To see the WEP option, you need to set the router’s mode to “Up to 54Mbps” (legacy 802.11a/b/g speed); then the WEP option will be available. <br>WEP is less secure than WPA, and is also slower, so NETGEAR does not recommend WEP mode.

"IMPORTANT NOTES"
"Android version supported: Android 2.2 or higher"
"General Information: To use the NETGEAR genie App, the Android device must be connected to one of the supported NETGEAR routers listed as below:"
"My Media:"
"My Media uses the default media player on an Android device to play media files if the Android device is being used as a player. Different Android versions support different ranges of media formats. The following list is based on Android version 4.0 supported media formats:"
"Supported audio formats: AAC, HE-AAC, AMR-NB, AMR-WB, FLAC, MP3, MIDI, Vorbis, and PCM/WAVE."
"Supported video formats: H.263, H.264 AVC, MPEG-4 SP, and VP8."
"Supported photo formats: JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP, and WEBP."
"For more information on supported media formats, see the Technical Specifications for your Android device."
"Please note when using My Media:"
"Each supported media format has limitations in media encoding parameters, such as bitrate, frame rate, and resolution. When My Media is unable to play media files with the supported formats, it may be because the files have higher bitrates or frame rates that exceed the rate it can support."
"The devices listed in Player view will be your own device, and other devices available in the network, such as PCs, TVs, stereos, or smartphones."
"The Android NETGEAR genie needs to be running in the My Media function to show up as a player or source."
"Some media files can be played in some players, but can't be played in other players. Different player supports different kinds of media file formats. For more information, see the Technical Specifications for the player."
"If My Media can't find any source or any player, it may be because your device is disconnected from the NETGEAR router. Make sure it is connected to the NETGEAR router by checking the Wi-Fi connection in Settings."
"After any change in the network, including Wi-Fi setting, source folder change, and list of player change, you will need to restart the media service and refresh the source folder in the Options view."
"When playing media files on your own Android device, tapping the screen brings up play progress and player control."
"It sometimes takes a long time to access and play a media file. This may be caused by a slow network, large file size, or heavy load in the player or source device."
"iOS version supported: iOS 4.2.1 or higher"
"General Information: To use the NETGEAR genie App, the iOS device must be connected to one of the supported NETGEAR routers listed as below:"
"My Media uses the default media player on an iOS device to play media files if the iOS device is being used as a player. Supported media formats are:"
"Supported audio formats: AAC, HE-AAC, MP3, Apple Lossless, AIFF and WAV."
"Supported video formats: H.264, MPEG-4, and M-JPEG."
"Supported photo formats: JPG, TIFF, GIF, PNG, and BMP."
"For more information on supported media formats, see the Technical Specifications for your iOS device." 
"The devices listed in Player view will be your own device, and other devices available in the network, such as PCs, TVs, stereos, or smartphones. If you select another device to play media files in Player view, you may encounter some of the following behaviors, which are not the bugs for My Media:" 
"The iOS NETGEAR genie needs to be running in the My Media function to show up as a player or source." 
"genie can show photos and videos in Source view if you grant genie permission to access the location service. genie can't play music from the iOS device in this version." 
"Use the File Sharing feature to transfer media files from your computer to genie. After genie is installed and the iOS device is connected to iTunes, go to the Apps tab. The File Sharing section is at the bottom of the page. Select genie in Apps, then drag and drop the media files to the genie Document list box."
"When playing media files on your own iOS device, tapping the screen brings up play progress and player control. "
