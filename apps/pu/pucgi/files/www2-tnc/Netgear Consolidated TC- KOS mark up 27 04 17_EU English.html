    party sites. We recommend You review the privacy policies of each third
    party site before You allow the SingleSignOn to connect with Your accounts
    on such third party sites or share pages or information with Your friends
    through those sites.

<p>
    25.3 <u>Waiver and Severability of Terms</u>. The failure of NETGEAR to
    exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms and Conditions
    will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision
