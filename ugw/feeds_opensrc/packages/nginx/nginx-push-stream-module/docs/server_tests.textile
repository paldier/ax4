h1(#tests). Tests <a name="tests" href="#">&nbsp;</a>

The tests for this module are written in Ruby, and are acceptance tests.
To run them is needed to have an environment with:

* ruby >= 1.9.3
* bundler >= 1.1.4

and install required gems doing:

<pre>
cd misc/
bundle install --without docs
</pre>

Then issue @rake spec@.
This command run the tests using nginx *executable* located at _/usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx_ with _1_ *worker* responding at *host* _127.0.0.1_ and *port* _9990_.
To change this behavior use the commands bellow

<pre>
NGINX_EXEC="../build/nginx-1.2.0/objs/nginx" rake spec   # to change default path for nginx executable
NGINX_HOST="my_machine" rake spec                        # to change default hostname
NGINX_PORT=9889 rake spec                                # to change default port
NGINX_WORKERS=2 rake spec                                # to change dafault number of workers used

and can combine any of these parameters, like:

NGINX_PORT=9889 NGINX_EXEC="../build/nginx-1.2.0/objs/nginx" rake spec
</pre>
