#CVE-2017-8890
#The inet_csk_clone_lock function in net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.15 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (double free) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of the accept system call.

dccp/tcp: do not inherit mc_list from parent
syzkaller found a way to trigger double frees from ip_mc_drop_socket()

It turns out that leave a copy of parent mc_list at accept() time,
which is very bad.

Very similar to commit 8b485ce69876 ("tcp: do not inherit
fastopen_req from parent")

Initial report from Pray3r, completed by Andrey one.
Thanks a lot to them !
